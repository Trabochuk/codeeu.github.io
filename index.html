        		<h1>Why #codeEU?</h1>
		        <p><strong>Coding is fun.</strong> Creative. Full of great people and passionate communities.</p>

				<p><strong>You're already passionate about helping others see the beauty in code.</strong> The fun in building stuff. </p>

				<p>But you can't yet convince your friends to start learning. Or maybe you are willing to organize a workshop, but are not so keen about talking with sponsors and doing all the PR. Yeah, we know the feeling.</p>

			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h1>Stronger together!</h1>
				<p><strong>So here's the deal</strong>: we want to connect individuals, groups, organizations, and companies, who are able to help more people experience the joy of coding.</p>

				<p><strong>With your help</strong>, we can start a big fire that will be seen outside our usual circles. A fire so big it can no longer be ignored by the big media, no matter what the latest celebrity gossip is. <strong>We know how much fun it is to build things and we're ready to share our passion.</strong></p>

				<p>Sounds interesting? Well then, let's all do something really big between:</p>
				<h1>November 25 - 30, 2013</h1> 

				<p>Organize a programming workshop, the one you planned to do in any case. Find a few friends who're curious about what you do and teach them how to code. Start a local study or support group for coding beginners. And remember, two is a group already.</p>
